    <h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

    <p>
      Here are 2 ideas for my final project.
    </p>
    <p class="margin"></p>

    <h4>Idea 1 : Pigeon Belt</h4>
    <p>
      A normal-looking leather belt that vibrates in the direction of north. Embedded with compasses and vibrators, as
      well as a microcontroller and battery, the MVP of this idea simply has an on-off switch and vibrates whichever
      vibrating actuator is facing north whenever it faces north (So if the user were to spin in circles, the belt would
      vibrate in a wave around the user).

    </p>

    <p>
      Stretch goal: create a companion app for the belt that allows it to send the wearer walking directions from google
      maps, by vibrating in a different pattern whenever they approach an intersection.

    </p>

    <p>
      Why is the working title "pigeon belt"? Pigeons always know where north is -- they have an internal compass. Very
      cool, for an ugly bird! Whenever I'm exploring a new place, my sense of direction is highly reliant on direct
      sunlight -- but on overcast days or in cities, that's hard to find. A subconsious cue that subtly orients my body
      to north would be massively helpful to navigating unfamiliar environments.

    <h4>Idea 2: Slitheridoo</h4>
    <p class="margin"></p>
    <p>
      Didgeridoos are a beautiful instrument invented by indigenous Australians. I've played one for most of my life.
      But there are cultural and pragmatic problems. As a non-indigenous white-passing Australian, playing this
      instrument carries a burden of colonial appropriation. From a pragmatic standpoint, they're just big -- 4-5 feet
      long, made out of heavy wood.

    </p>
    <p>
      How might a 3D-printed instrument that uses the same mechanics as a didgeridoo, but in a new form factor, honor
      the heritage without carrying any of the cultural burdens, and allow greater travelability?
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretch goal 1: construct the slitheridoo out of a translucent plastic and rig it with LEDs such that it lights up
      in response to the volume and pitch of the sounds played.
    </p>
