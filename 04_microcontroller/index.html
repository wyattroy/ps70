<h4>Assignment: Make Arduino Do Something</h4>
<p>
  This week featured a staggering series of undiagnosable failures. Here is an absurdly simple circuit that I spent four (4!) hours trying -- unsuccessfully -- to get to work.
</p>
<p>

<p>
  Behold my submission to this week's assignment: a non-functional button.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
  I used the arduino reference manual, PS70 wesbite, gpt, and extensive googling to try and figure out why my serial monitor was either receiving only garbarge signals, or zeros. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  My code: <br/>
  <pre><code>#define switchPin 4 // I also tried 5, 14, and 15

  void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    pinMode(switchPin, INPUT_PULLUP);  // I also tried using a PULLDOWN with a 10k ohm resistor
  }
  
  void loop() {
    int state = digitalRead(switchPin);
    Serial.println(state);
    delay(200); // So many garbage values were flooding the terminal so I introduced this delay
  }
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, literally all I could figure out how to get this thing to do was turn on a green LED using the always-on power supply.
</p>

<p>
  Hardware is hard.
</p>

<h5>LED circuitry</h5>
<p>
  I tried to do something simple next - just get 4 LEDs to work in a circuit.
</p>
<p>

<p>
  This actually worked! Notice how there was no microcontroller to make things difficult.

<h5>Soldering</h5>
<p>
  Given that my electronics were such a staggering fail, I decided to practice a core skill 
  that would be useful in future projects -- soldering. 
  
</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/circuit.png" alt="circuit diagram">
</p>
<p>
  I made a 4-LED array of white lights, 
  wired in parallel, each with its own resistor attached to it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/ledhand.jpg" alt="led hand">
  </p>
  <p>
  And I used this to upgrade my lamp from last week, wiring it with switches for both the lights and fan mechanism so that both can be turned on independently.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="images/fanleds.jpeg" alt="fan leds">
</p>
<p>
  Then I upgraded all of the components, including designing and lasering a new gear for the quieter motor, and soldering everything together.

<h5>
  Conclusion
</h5>
<p>
  This week was rough. Microcontrollers are so fickle -- it was unclear what was going wrong, and even more frustrating, it was unclear how to diagnose what might be going wrong -- especially when the issues may be physical, or may be a busted board, or a loose wire. After you try 100 different things and none work, it may be time to take a breath (or get a new esp32).
</p>

</p>

<h5>UPDATE</h5>
<p>
  Kassia gave me a different ESP32 which actually works.<br/>
  Joey helped me figure out how to get it set up in the Arduino IDE. <br />
  Bobby assured me that bad days happen. And so do good days. And gave me a solid dap. <br />
</p>
<p>
  And now... IT WORKS!

  My most important learning today: working alone is best done with a base level competency. Learning alone is brutal. Huge shoutout to this class and teaching staff for all of the support. You make making fun.
