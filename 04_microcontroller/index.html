<h4>Assignment 1: Make Arduino Do Something</h4>
<p>
  This week featured a staggering series of undiagnosable failures. Here is an absurdly simple circuit that I spent four (4!) hours trying to get to work.

  This, unfortunately, is my submission to this week's assignment. I used the arduino reference manual, gpt, and extensive googling to try and figure out why my serial monitor was either receiving only garbarge signals, or zeros.

  Unfortunately, literally all I could figure out how to get this thing to do was turn on a green LED. Without a button.

  Maybe someone can help me fall in love with electronics again. I'm currently feeling pretty upset with them.

<h5>LED circuitry</h5>
<p>
  I tried to do something simple next - just get 4 LEDs to work in a circuit.

  This actually worked! Notice how there was no microcontroller to make things difficult.

<h5>Soldering</h5>
<p>
  Given that my electronics were such a staggering fail, I decided to practice a core skill that would be useful in future projects -- soldering. I made a 4-LED array of white lights, wired in parallel, each with its own resistor attached to it. And I used this to upgrade my lamp from last week, wiring it with switches for both the lights and fan mechanism so that both can be turned on independently.

<h5>
  Conclusion
</h5>
<p>
  This week was rough. Microcontrollers are so fickle -- it's unclear what could be going wrong, and even more frustrating, it's totally unclear how to diagnose what might be going wrong -- especially when the issues may be physical, or may be a busted board, or a loose wire. Sigh.
