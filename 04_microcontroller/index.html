<h4>Assignment 1: Make Arduino Do Something</h4>
<p>
  This week featured a staggering series of undiagnosable failures. Here is an absurdly simple circuit that I spent four (4!) hours trying to get to work.
</p>

<p>
  This, unfortunately, is my submission to this week's assignment. I used the arduino reference manual, gpt, and extensive googling to try and figure out why my serial monitor was either receiving only garbarge signals, or zeros. 
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, literally all I could figure out how to get this thing to do was turn on a green LED. Without a button.

<p>
  Maybe someone can help me fall in love with electronics again. I'm currently feeling pretty upset with them.

<h5>LED circuitry</h5>
<p>
  I tried to do something simple next - just get 4 LEDs to work in a circuit.

  This actually worked! Notice how there was no microcontroller to make things difficult.

<h5>Soldering</h5>
<p>
  Given that my electronics were such a staggering fail, I decided to practice a core skill 
  that would be useful in future projects -- soldering. I made a 4-LED array of white lights, 
  wired in parallel, each with its own resistor attached to it. 
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
  And I used this to upgrade my lamp from last week, wiring it with switches for both the lights and fan mechanism so that both can be turned on independently.
</p>

<p>
  Then I upgraded all of the components, including designing and lasering a new gear for the quieter motor, and soldering everything together.

<h5>
  Conclusion
</h5>
<p>
  This week was rough. Microcontrollers are so fickle -- it was unclear what was going wrong, and even more frustrating, it was unclear how to diagnose what might be going wrong -- especially when the issues may be physical, or may be a busted board, or a loose wire. After you try 100 different things and none work, it may be time to take a breath (or get a new esp32).
