I design things that help people navigate their lives in ways that feel inspiring and fun instead of stressful and overwhelming. 

</p>
<p id="aboutme">
  My XR work invites viewers to become active players in their own stories. My interactive projects question our sense of self and help us expand it by learning new skills, harnessing our emotions, and adopting other perspectives.  My design work mashes multiple mediums together to create objects and experiences that shift our understanding of reality. My videos apply psychology theory to increase the potency of linear stories and change their viewers’ perspectives. As an American raised in Sydney, my projects combine both of my cultures, mixing the tangled emotional interiority of Australian films with California’s adventurous sense of agency. 
</p>
<p id="aboutme">
  My primary goal is to combine all of these disciplines to design, prototype and test the storytelling conventions of spatial stories - primarily in XR - so that we can harness their potential to craft stories that help us learn more quickly, heal more completely, and communicate more deeply.
